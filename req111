Hello. Can we talk about the project? The platform, how will it be done?
hi nice to meet you.
yes,
we can discuss project now.
i think there are 2 user roles.
admin and customer.
User Avatar
ok
and customer can register this site,
and he can set his profile with photo.
and admin can show all users' sata after login.
and when click each user, he can show his all information.
right?
i think it is site total system.
User Avatar
it's almost that. We work with electronics repair. I need the branches to receive the devices, make the customer's sheet (offline) and transmit the forms to a platform (on line) where both the administrator and the branch, can access, search and change information.
can you explain customer sheet?
and what's mean branch?
customers sheet = Name, address, phone number, etc of the customer. Data of the electronic product he is leaving for repair (make, model, serial number, etc). Product photos. That kind of information.
User Avatar
branch = affiliate, subsidiary
so branch is customer who i said?
User Avatar
no, i will try explain better. Just a second.
yes
User Avatar
I'm going to make a diagram, I think it's going to be easier for me to explain it to you. Can I send this to you tomorrow?
thanks.
good sounds.
so can you post houly project for me now again?
User Avatar
sorry, "houly" i dont know this word. Could you explain me?
oh, sorry
hourly.
when you post project, you can select fixed or hourly .
User Avatar
Oh, ok, I get it.
in my profile, you can click "hire" button.
User Avatar

hi
have a good weekend?
I checked your document.
We didn't fully understand the requirements, but we almost did.
I think it isn't so easy.

So you think that it isn't possible to be done?
of course it is possible.
User Avatar
but...
please tell me time.
is it urgent project?
No, it inst urgent.
User Avatar
Do you prefer to analyze and answer me later?
i already analyzed.
User Avatar
You said you didn't fully understand the requirements. What were your doubts?
one minute...
User Avatar
Ok. Maybe I can clarify.
you wrote you have wordpress site.
can i see it?
www.tvsales.com.br
User Avatar
but it's just a presentation site. There is no different program in it.
yes
there isn't admin panel.
so i think it needs 3 roles.
super admin, admin, customer.
Customer just arrives with a product in a subsidiary
User Avatar
yes
and he can see its progress.
and admin register this product in customer's form.
and super admin and admin manage it.
Just a moment.
User Avatar
Only employees will have access to this information, the consumer will not
so can't customer see product progress?
User Avatar
No, the platform is a communication between subsidiary and main store. Only that.
so i think this project doesn't need customer account.
correct?
Right. This is correct.
User Avatar
only subsidiary account and main store account.
yes
and
"The data form that is filled in by the subsidiary has to be printed"
print is mean pdf export?
but each subsidiary has to have its own account.
and
User Avatar
yes, in pdf, no problem.
own account?
what's difference between own and emplyee account?
User Avatar
There are several subsidiaries, so each subsidiary has to have its individual account.
yes
so i will make 2 roles.
main store(super admin),
and subsidiary account.
User Avatar
ok, just so there is no misunderstanding. There will be several subsidiaries, so there will be several subsidiary accounts, right?
yes
ok.
User Avatar
did you have any more questions?
but i think this budget is not enough.
ok. how much?
User Avatar
and how much time you need
i should make frontend(website) and backend(logic) from scratch.
so i need 5-6 days.
no problem?
User Avatar
this time is no problem to me, but about the budget?
i want you to pay 250$ for it.
User Avatar
right, i need to think about
thanks. i wil wait your respose.
User Avatar
ok, thanks.
